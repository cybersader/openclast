# VNC/Remote Desktop Gateway Options

Comparison of browser-based remote desktop solutions for Layer 1.

***

## Current Status: Evaluating

Need to select between Kasm, Guacamole, or Selkies for production. POC uses docker-compose with linuxserver/obsidian.

***

## Options

### Kasm Workspaces

**Website**: [https://kasmweb.com/](https://kasmweb.com/)

**Type**: Enterprise VDI platform

**Pros**:

* Enterprise-ready with SSO integration
* Session management and persistence
* Container-based isolation
* Scaling and load balancing
* Good documentation

**Cons**:

* Licensing cost (enterprise features)
* Requires VM or bare metal (not LXC/WSL)
* More complex to set up

**Best For**: Enterprise deployments with budget for licensing.

**Notes**:

* Can use linuxserver single-container version for POC
* Full version needs dedicated infrastructure
* Supports OIDC, SAML, LDAP

***

### Apache Guacamole

**Website**: [https://guacamole.apache.org/](https://guacamole.apache.org/)

**Type**: Open source clientless remote desktop gateway

**Pros**:

* Completely free and open source
* Simple to deploy
* Supports VNC, RDP, SSH
* Well-documented
* Active community

**Cons**:

* Less enterprise features (session management)
* Manual scaling
* UI less polished than Kasm

**Best For**: POC, small teams, budget-conscious deployments.

**Notes**:

* Uses guacd daemon + web frontend
* Can add SSO with OIDC extension
* Docker images available

***

### Selkies / GStreamer

**Website**: [https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer)

**Type**: WebRTC-based remote desktop

**Pros**:

* WebRTC = lower latency than VNC
* GPU acceleration support
* Modern architecture

**Cons**:

* Newer, less mature
* More complex setup
* Fewer enterprise features

**Best For**: Performance-critical, low-latency requirements.

**Notes**:

* Used by Google for cloud gaming
* Requires GPU for best performance
* Can be combined with other solutions

***

### noVNC + Custom Orchestration

**Website**: [https://novnc.com/](https://novnc.com/)

**Type**: HTML5 VNC client

**Pros**:

* Lightweight
* Open source
* Can build custom solution

**Cons**:

* DIY orchestration needed
* No built-in session management
* More development work

**Best For**: Custom implementations, learning.

| Setup Complexity   | Medium     | Low        | High          | Medium |
| Documentation      | Excellent  | Good       | Fair          | Good   |

***

## Recommendation

**For POC**: Apache Guacamole (free, simple, proven)

**For Enterprise**: Kasm Workspaces (SSO, session management, scaling)

**For Low-Latency**: Selkies (WebRTC, but more complex)
