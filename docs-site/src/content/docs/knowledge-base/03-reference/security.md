# Security Considerations

Ongoing security concerns and mitigations for the project.

***

## Threat Model

### Assets

1. **Vault content** - User knowledge bases
2. **Credentials** - SSO tokens, session data
3. **Infrastructure** - Servers, containers

### Threat Actors

1. **Unauthorized external** - Internet attackers
2. **Unauthorized internal** - Employees without access
3. **Authorized but malicious** - Insider threats

***

## Security Layers

### Layer 1: VNC Gateway

| Concern               | Mitigation                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Session hijacking     | SSO with MFA, session timeouts |
| VNC protocol exposure | HTTPS/WSS only, no raw VNC     |
| Container escape      | Hardened base images, no root  |

### Layer 2: CRDT Sync

| Concern               | Mitigation                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Data interception     | TLS for WebSocket transport |
| State file tampering  | Signed CRDT states (future) |
| DoS via large updates | Size limits, rate limiting  |

### Layer 3: Mount Orchestration

| Concern                   | Mitigation                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Unauthorized vault access | JWT validation, group checking  |
| Privilege escalation      | Vault-level RBAC, no file-level |
| Audit evasion             | Immutable audit logs            |

## Authentication & Authorization

### SSO Integration

* Use OIDC/SAML with enterprise IdP
* MFA required for sensitive vaults
* Short session timeouts

### RBAC Model

```
User → IdP Groups → Vault Permissions → Mount Control
```

No file-level permissions by design. See [Decision-002](../resources/decisions/decision-log.md#decision-002-rbac-at-vault-level-not-file-level).

***

## Data Protection

### At Rest

* Vault files on encrypted storage
* CRDT state files alongside content
* Secrets in secure vault (HashiCorp Vault?)

### In Transit

* TLS 1.3 for all connections
* WebSocket over HTTPS (WSS)
* No plaintext protocols

### Backups

* Regular vault backups
* Point-in-time recovery via CRDT history
* Backup encryption

***

## Plugin Security

### Obsidian Plugins

| Risk                  | Mitigation                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Malicious plugins     | Curated plugin list, no auto-update |
| Plugin network access | Firewall rules per plugin (ideal)   |
| Data exfiltration     | Network monitoring, DLP             |

### Plugin Management

Options:

1. **Whitelist approach** - Only approved plugins
2. **Block GitHub** - No plugin downloads, manual install
3. **Review process** - Audit before approval

See \[Obsidian Setup for Corporate]\(cyberbase vault) for detailed approach.

***

## Audit Logging

### Events to Log

* Vault access (mount)
* File operations (create, modify, delete)
* Authentication events
* Failed access attempts

### Log Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-12-20T00:00:00Z",
  "event": "vault_access",
  "userId": "user@example.com",
  "vaultId": "engineering",
  "action": "mount",
  "result": "success",
  "clientIp": "10.0.0.1"
}
```

### Log Storage

* Structured JSON logs
* Ship to SIEM (Splunk, Elastic, etc.)
* Retention per compliance requirements

***

## Compliance Considerations

### SOC 2

* Access controls (RBAC)
* Audit logging
* Encryption in transit/at rest
* Incident response

### GDPR

* Data minimization
* Right to deletion (purge from CRDT?)
* Data export capability

### HIPAA (if applicable)

* BAA with cloud providers
* Access logging
* Encryption requirements

***

## Open Questions

1. **CRDT state signing** - How to verify state integrity?
2. **Binary file encryption** - Encrypt in MinIO?
3. **Key management** - Where to store encryption keys?
4. **Plugin isolation** - Can we sandbox plugins?
