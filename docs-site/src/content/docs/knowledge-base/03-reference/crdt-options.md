# CRDT Options Research

Comparison of CRDT libraries considered for this project.

***

## Selection: Yjs

**Chosen for**: Battle-tested, TypeScript support, good documentation, y-websocket transport.

***

## Options Evaluated

### Yjs (Selected)

**Website**: [https://docs.yjs.dev/](https://docs.yjs.dev/)

**Pros**:

* Used by Notion, Figma, Liveblocks
* Excellent TypeScript support
* Active community and development
* y-websocket provides simple WebSocket sync
* y-protocols for awareness (presence)
* Well-documented with examples

**Cons**:

* Binary files need separate handling
* State grows with edit history (can compact)

**Key Features**:

* Y.Doc per document
* Y.Text for text content
* Awareness protocol for presence
* Multiple providers (WebSocket, WebRTC, etc.)

***

### Automerge

**Website**: [https://automerge.org/](https://automerge.org/)

**Pros**:

* True CRDT with mathematical guarantees
* Rust core with WASM bindings
* Strong academic backing
* Good for complex data structures

**Cons**:

* Heavier than Yjs
* More complex API
* Overkill for text sync

**Why Not Chosen**: Yjs is simpler and sufficient for text/markdown sync.

***

### OctoBase (AFFiNE)

**Website**: [https://github.com/toeverything/OctoBase](https://github.com/toeverything/OctoBase)

**Pros**:

* Native binary file support
* Built for block-based editors
* Used by AFFiNE

**Cons**:

* Newer, less proven
* Tied to AFFiNE ecosystem
* Less documentation

**Why Not Chosen**: Risk of instability, less community support.

***

### Obsidian LiveSync (CouchDB)

**Website**: [https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync)

**Pros**:

* Built specifically for Obsidian
* Active development
* Self-hosted with CouchDB

**Cons**:

* NOT true CRDT (uses CouchDB revision trees)
* Conflict resolution not guaranteed
* Requires CouchDB infrastructure

**Why Not Chosen**: Not a true CRDT, conflicts possible.

***

### Relay Plugin (Yjs-based)

**Website**: [https://github.com/No-Instructions/Relay](https://github.com/No-Instructions/Relay)

**Pros**:

* Obsidian plugin using Yjs
* Solved "file on disk" problem with diff-match-patch
* Good reference implementation

**Cons**:

* Plugin-based (timing issues with file cache)
* Less control over sync architecture

**Why Referenced**: Good example of Yjs + Obsidian integration. Borrowed diff-match-patch approach.

***

## Key Learnings

1. **File on disk problem**: Obsidian's file cache causes timing issues. Solution: diff-match-patch to reconcile CRDT state with filesystem.

2. **Binary handling**: All CRDTs struggle with large binaries. Solution: store by hash in object storage, sync only references.

3. **Awareness protocol**: Yjs y-protocols provides presence (who's editing) out of the box.

4. **State growth**: CRDT state grows with edit history. Can compact periodically.
