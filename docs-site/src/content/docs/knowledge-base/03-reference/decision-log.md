## Decisions

### \[DECISION-001] Use Yjs for CRDT Implementation

**Date**: 2024-12-18
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need a CRDT library for conflict-free real-time sync between multiple Obsidian instances.

**Decision**: Use Yjs as the CRDT library.

**Rationale**:

* Battle-tested (used by Notion, Figma, etc.)
* Excellent TypeScript support
* Well-documented with active community
* y-websocket provides simple sync transport
* Works well with text content (markdown)

**Alternatives Considered**:

| Alternative       | Pros                  | Cons                                        | Why Rejected                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Automerge         | True CRDT, Rust core  | Heavier, more complex API                   | Overkill for text sync             |
| OctoBase          | Native binary support | Newer, less proven                          | Risk of instability                |
| Obsidian LiveSync | Built for Obsidian    | Uses CouchDB revision trees (NOT true CRDT) | Conflict resolution not guaranteed |

**Consequences**:

* Need to handle binary files separately (MinIO for storage)
* Must implement diff-match-patch for efficient text updates
* WebSocket transport required for real-time mode

***

### \[DECISION-002] RBAC at Vault Level, Not File Level

**Date**: 2024-12-18
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Enterprise needs access control for sensitive vaults. Options: control access per-file or per-vault.

**Decision**: Implement RBAC at vault mount time. If a user can mount a vault, they have full access to it.

**Rationale**:

* Dramatically simpler implementation
* Works with Obsidian's filesystem-based architecture
* Mount-time control is enforceable at container level
* File-level RBAC would fight Obsidian's design (it expects full filesystem access)

**Alternatives Considered**:

| Alternative             | Why Rejected                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File-level permissions  | Would require hiding files in UI, complex permission checks on every operation, fights Obsidian's architecture |
| Cerbos policies         | Considered for file-level, but decided vault-level is sufficient                                               |
| FUSE overlay filesystem | Complex, performance overhead, maintenance burden                                                              |

**Consequences**:

* Vaults must be organized by access level (can't have mixed permissions within a vault)
* Mount orchestration service needed to control what gets mounted
* Simpler audit logging (vault access, not per-file)

***

### \[DECISION-003] External Sync Daemon vs Obsidian Plugin

**Date**: 2024-12-18
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to sync file changes between Obsidian and CRDT system. Options: plugin inside Obsidian, or external daemon.

**Decision**: Use external sync daemon as primary, with optional plugin for enhancements.

**Rationale**:

* Obsidian's file cache causes timing issues (file on disk vs in-memory)
* Plugin crashes can crash Obsidian
* Daemon reads directly from filesystem after Obsidian writes (CLOSE\_WRITE events)
* More reliable and debuggable

**Alternatives Considered**:

| Alternative             | Why Rejected                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Plugin-only             | Timing issues with Obsidian's file cache, crashes affect app |
| Obsidian Relay approach | Good reference, but daemon is more robust                    |

**Consequences**:

* Daemon runs alongside Obsidian in container
* Uses inotify/chokidar for file watching
* Optional plugin can provide presence awareness and UI enhancements

***

### \[DECISION-004] Hybrid Plugin Modes (File + Server)

**Date**: 2024-12-19
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to support both enterprise (server-based) and individual (SMB/cloud sync) use cases.

**Decision**: Single plugin with three modes: file-only, hybrid, server-only.

**Rationale**:

* Progressive adoption: start with file-only, add server when ready
* Same underlying problem: SMB conflicts = web collaboration conflicts
* Plugin-only mode enables zero-infrastructure adoption
* Hybrid mode provides best of both worlds

**Alternatives Considered**:

| Alternative      | Why Rejected                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Separate plugins | Duplicate code, confusing for users      |
| Server-only      | Requires infrastructure, limits adoption |
| File-only        | No real-time capability for enterprise   |

**Consequences**:

* Plugin stores CRDT state in `.crdt/` folder
* Settings UI allows mode selection
* Server mode requires y-websocket endpoint

***

### \[DECISION-005] Binary Files via Hash References to MinIO

**Date**: 2024-12-18
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: CRDT struggles with large binary files (images, PDFs). Need a solution for attachments.

**Decision**: Store binaries in MinIO, reference by hash in CRDT.

**Rationale**:

* CRDTs are inefficient for large binary blobs
* Content-addressable storage (hash = filename) enables deduplication
* MinIO is S3-compatible, self-hosted
* Only hash syncs via CRDT, actual bytes stored once

**Alternatives Considered**:

| Alternative         | Why Rejected                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Full binary in CRDT | Huge state, slow sync, memory issues   |
| Git LFS style       | Adds complexity, not designed for CRDT |
| Skip binary sync    | Users expect attachments to sync       |

**Consequences**:

* Markdown references like `![image](crdt://sha256:abc123)`
* Need resolver to map hash to MinIO URL
* Binary upload/download handled separately from CRDT

***

### \[DECISION-006] Per-Client CRDT State Files

**Date**: 2024-12-19
**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: For file-only sync mode, need to store CRDT state somewhere that syncs via SMB/Dropbox.

**Decision**: Store per-client state files: `.crdt/{path}.{clientId}.yjs`

**Rationale**:

* Each client owns one file - no write conflicts
* SMB/Dropbox syncs both files without creating conflict copies
* On open: merge all `.yjs` files
* CRDT math ensures merge is deterministic

**Alternatives Considered**:

| Alternative              | Why Rejected                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Single shared state file | SMB/Dropbox creates conflict copies  |
| Operation log (JSONL)    | Grows unbounded, needs compaction    |
| Per-client folders       | Harder to find all states for a file |

**Consequences**:

* Client ID generated on first plugin install
* `.crdt/` folder should be in `.obsidianignore` to hide from file explorer
* State files are binary Yjs encoding (compact)

## Pending Decisions

### \[DECISION-TBD] VNC Gateway Selection

**Status**: Under Evaluation

**Options**:

* Kasm Workspaces (enterprise, licensing cost)
* Apache Guacamole (open source, simpler)
* Selkies/GStreamer (WebRTC, lower latency)

**Evaluation Criteria**:

* SSO integration
* Session management
* Scaling capability
* Licensing cost
* Latency

***

### \[DECISION-TBD] Kubernetes vs Docker Compose for Production

**Status**: Deferred

**Context**: POC uses docker-compose. Production may need Kubernetes.

**Considerations**:

* Scaling sync servers
* Session persistence
* Container orchestration
* Complexity vs capability
