# Obsidian-in-Browser Knowledge Base

This knowledge base follows the **temperature gradient** system for organizing project knowledge.

## Temperature Zones

```
HOT                                                                        COLD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  00-inbox/   01-working/   02-learnings/   03-reference/   04-archive/
      |            |              |               |              |
    today      this week     permanent        stable            done
```

| Zone | Folder | Temperature | Content | Lifespan |
|------|--------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Capture | `00-inbox/` | HOT | Quick captures, unprocessed notes | Hours-days |
| Active | `01-working/` | WARM | Drafts, active synthesis, roadmaps | Days-weeks |
| Insights | `02-learnings/` | COOL | Distilled insights, explorations | Permanent |
| Stable | `03-reference/` | COLD | Architecture docs, decision logs, guides | Permanent |
| Filed | `04-archive/` | FROZEN | Completed research, link collections | Long-term |

## How Content Flows

- Content matures from hot to cold, never the reverse
- Direct paths are fine: a clear insight can skip inbox and go straight to `02-learnings/`
- Files in `02-learnings/` use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for searchability
- Files in `03-reference/` are kebab-case (stable, frequently linked)
