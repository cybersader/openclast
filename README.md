# Obsidian in Enterprise

> Browser-based Obsidian with CRDT sync and enterprise access control. Stream Obsidian via VNC, collaborate in real-time with Yjs, and control vault access at the folder level.

## The Problem

Organizations want Obsidian for knowledge management but face blockers: no browser access, no real-time collaboration, no role-based access control, and data sovereignty concerns with local installs.

## Three-Layer Architecture

```
Browser → VNC Gateway (Kasm) → Obsidian Container
                                      ↕
                                CRDT Sync Daemon (Yjs)
                                      ↕
                                Other Users' Containers

Mount Orchestrator: JWT claims → per-user bind mounts → composite vault
```

**Layer 1 — VNC Gateway**: Kasm Workspaces streams Obsidian desktop to the browser. Full experience, zero installs.

**Layer 2 — CRDT Sync**: Yjs-based real-time collaboration. Multiple users edit simultaneously with automatic conflict resolution.

**Layer 3 — Mount Orchestration**: Translates user identity + group membership into per-user Docker bind mounts. Each user's vault is assembled from only the folders they're authorized to access.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cybersader/obsidian-in-enterprise.git
cd obsidian-in-enterprise
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up -d
# Obsidian at https://localhost:3001
```

### Multi-Instance Testing

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
# Alice: https://localhost:3101
# Bob:   https://localhost:3201
```

## Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `docker/obsidian-kasm/` | Custom Obsidian container with sync daemon |
| `sync-daemon/` | Node.js Yjs CRDT sync service (inotify + WebSocket) |
| `obsidian-plugin/` | Obsidian plugin with file-based and server sync modes |
| `orchestrator/` | Mount orchestration service (pending) |
| `config/` | Vault permission configuration (YAML) |
| `knowledge-base/` | Project knowledge base (temperature gradient system) |
| `docs-site/` | Astro Starlight documentation site |

## Documentation

The [documentation site](https://cybersader.github.io/obsidian-in-enterprise) is built from the knowledge base using Astro Starlight with the `starlight-obsidian` plugin. All content lives in this repo — no Obsidian installation needed to contribute.

The knowledge base uses a **temperature gradient** system:

| Zone | Path | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| HOT | `00-inbox/` | Quick captures |
| WARM | `01-working/` | Active research and decisions |
| COOL | `02-learnings/` | Distilled insights (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE) |
| COLD | `03-reference/` | Stable architecture docs |
| FROZEN | `04-archive/` | Completed research |

- [Decision Log](knowledge-base/03-reference/decision-log.md) — All architectural decisions with rationale
